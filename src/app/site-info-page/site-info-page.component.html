    <p>
      This website uses a <strong>Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)</strong>, built with PyTorch,
      to predict the price of land per square meter based on location and size.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model was trained on structured data including city, neighborhood, lot size,
      and additional geographic features like proximity to the sea, public transport, parks, malls, and more.
      Inputs are normalized and one-hot encoded.
    </p>
    <p>
      By clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, you’ll be taken to a page where you can enter
      the city, neighborhood, and lot size. The model will estimate the land price in that specific area.

      <h3>📊 Model Accuracy</h3>
      <p>
        The model achieves an <strong>average error rate of just 16%</strong> — showing high predictive performance!
        In the "Rakafot" neighborhood in Be’er Sheva, the prediction differed by only <strong>0.1 ILS</strong>!

      <h3>💡 Interesting Fact</h3>
      <p>
        The highest land prices were found in <em>Atlit – Ein Carmel</em>,
        while the lowest were in <em>Arad – Rannanim</em> and <em>Netivot</em> — 
        showing a big gap in land values across Israel.
